# My-Personal-Assitant
My personal assistant that can give me an answer to all types of question,and read latest news for you as she gathers informations from platforms such as Wikipedia, Quora, Maps, Google, HindustanTimes.

For queries such as Who is "xyz" or What is "abc", she gathers information from respective wikipedia pages using wikipedia API for python.

She collects latest news by scraping the latest news page from HindustanTimes website.

If you ask for a location like where is "rivendell", she opens that location on google map.

For all other questions, she scraps the most viewed answer from quora and reads that for you. (This feature allows her to answer almost all types of questions.)
